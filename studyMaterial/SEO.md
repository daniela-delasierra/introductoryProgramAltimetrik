# SEO

SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization, which is the practice of increasing the quantity and quality of traffic to your website through organic search engine results.

## What goes into SEO?

To understand the true meaning of SEO, let's break that definition down and look at the parts:

Quality of traffic. You can attract all the visitors in the world, but if they're coming to your site because Google tells them you're a resource for Apple computers when really you're a farmer selling apples, that is not quality traffic. Instead, you want to attract visitors who are genuinely interested in the products that you offer.

Quantity of traffic. Once you have the right people clicking through from those search engine results pages (SERPs - Search Engine Results Page), more traffic is better.

Organic results. Ads make up a significant portion of many SERPs (Search Engine Results Page). Organic traffic is any traffic that you don't have to pay for.

**On-page SEO** refers to the elements that are included on the site, technical configurations as well as content, that search engines will take into consideration, including but not limited to:

- Title 
- Tags
- Meta
- Descriptions
- Headings
- URL structure
- Main page copy
- Image Alt descriptions
- Load speed
- Mobile friendliness

**Off-page SEO** also helps improve your site ranking, but it's harder to take action to directly improve it. That's because off-page SEO involves sites that aren't yours, but are linking to you. This may include:

- Blogs and articles that link to your content
- Video, audio, or image-sharing sites that host off-site content
- Directories and company review sites

## What exactly does the Open Graph protocol offer?

Using the protocol allows you to optimize your content for clicks within these networks, which can then in turn impact your traffic, brand reputation and even your search engine rankings. When your content gets noticed and regularly shared, it will increase the links to your website, the number of visitors to your website and the engagement of your brand online.
